You did a great job implementing the inter-process communication (IPC) 
between the teach and the student threads. You have received 5 out of 5 
on this assignment. Your thread design worked well and your simulation 
of the scenario performed the necessary functionality without a 
deadlock. This is an example of how operating systems need to 
communicate between different processes who are requesting services from 
I/O and other processes in the system. You did a great job with this 
simulation.
