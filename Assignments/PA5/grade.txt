You have received 5 out of 5 on assignment 5 for the OS class. Your 
analysis of the CPU algorithms you selected was complete and and you 
included a good level of detail and comparison criteria. There are 
situations when the algorithms are implemented in different ways that 
cause either more or less efficiency depending on the type of jobs that 
are being scheduled. You provided a nice comparison that was fair for 
your selected algorithms. I hope this assignment helps you to better 
understand some of the difficulties OS developers encounter when they 
attempt to schedule work for processing in today's modern OS environments.
