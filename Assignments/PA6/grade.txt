You have received 5 out of 5 on assignment 6 for the OS class. Your 
memory management comparison was good and it included a good level of 
details and analysis. I hope that this assignment has helped you to 
research and learn the differences between the different memory 
concepts. You will want to review this chapter and assignment before the 
final exam as you will see questions about Main and Virtual memory on 
the final.
