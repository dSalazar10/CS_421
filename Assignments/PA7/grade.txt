You have received 5 out of 5 on the last assignment for the Operating 
Systems class. Your demonstration of the LRU algorithm was good. I could 
see your page faults and understand your logic. You implemented a good 
demonstration with clear output. Nice work on the last assignment for 
this class. Hopefully, this exercise will help you remember how the LRU 
page replacement algorithm works.
