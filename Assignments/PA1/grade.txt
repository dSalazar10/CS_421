You have received 5 out of 5 on assignment 1 for the OS class. Your 
shell functionality was quite good. You implemented the correct 
functionality for both the internal and external features. I like how 
you kept track of the jobs in the system. You have demonstrated a good 
understanding of how a shell is designed and how threads work in C. Nice 
work on the program design as well as on the source code creation. Your 
use of threads was effective! Overall, you are off to an excellent start 
in this class!
