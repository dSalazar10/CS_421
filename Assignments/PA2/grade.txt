You did a great job with the "copy file" program for the operating 
systems class (assignment 2). You have earned 5 out of 5. You 
implemented the correct functionality using threads and you properly 
copied the file using synchronized behaviors between the two threads. 
Nice work on the program design and functionality. You can use these 
same concepts as a bases for the creation of the logic and thread 
synchronization of your next threading challenge, assignment 3.
